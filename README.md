# World Football

A home for data analysis and modeling with all types of football (aka "soccer" :smile:) data

### Datasets in use:
- [Fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/soccer-spi)
    - `spi_matches` contains match by match SPI ratings, forecasts, and outcomes starting in 2016
    - `spi_global_rankings` contains current SPI ratings for club teams
    - `spi_global_rankings_intl` contains current SPI ratings for international teams


### Analysis Ideas:
- Payroll or transfer fee allocation strategies
- Effects of long travel times on match outcomes
- Quantifying home field advantage
- Player distance covered in matches
- How do teams play differently against the very best (Messi, Ronaldo, etc)
