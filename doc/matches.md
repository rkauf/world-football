First, let's explore the data structure of each of these files


```r
spi_matches %>%

  knitr::kable()
```

#### Initial questions about the matches dataset:
- Does SPI change by match, or is it constant for each team across all matches?
- Does can I deduce home team from the columns? (Is home team = team1?)
- What are the nsxg columns and adj_score columns?
- Are second division matches captured?

Great! We have second division data for England, France, Spain, Germany, and Italy upon first glance. It could be interesting to look at predicting promotion or relegation. 

##### SPI


```r
spi_matches %>% 
  select(match_id, date, team1, team2, spi1, spi2) %>%
  gather(team_num, team, team1:team2) %>% 
  gather(spi_num, spi, spi1:spi2) %>% 
  mutate(team_num = str_remove_all(team_num, "[^0-9]"),
         spi_num = str_remove_all(spi_num, "[^0-9]")) %>% 
  filter(team_num == spi_num, team == "Manchester City") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date, spi)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = team_num)) +
  theme_expapp() +
  ggtitle("Manchester City's SPI Over Time")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](../graphs/matches//unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

Okay, so the SPI is current as of the match and is changing. There also seem to be about an equal number of records with team num = 1 as there are for 2. Let's verify that team1 is the home team, real quick.


```r
spi_matches %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  select(date, league, team1, team2)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 4
##    date       league                  team1           team2               
##    <date>     <chr>                   <chr>           <chr>               
##  1 2016-08-12 French Ligue 1          Bastia          Paris Saint-Germain 
##  2 2016-08-12 French Ligue 1          AS Monaco       Guingamp            
##  3 2016-08-13 Barclays Premier League Hull City       Leicester City      
##  4 2016-08-13 Barclays Premier League Burnley         Swansea City        
##  5 2016-08-13 Barclays Premier League Middlesbrough   Stoke City          
##  6 2016-08-13 Barclays Premier League Southampton     Watford             
##  7 2016-08-13 Barclays Premier League Everton         Tottenham Hotspur   
##  8 2016-08-13 Barclays Premier League Crystal Palace  West Bromwich Albion
##  9 2016-08-13 French Ligue 1          Bordeaux        St Etienne          
## 10 2016-08-13 Barclays Premier League Manchester City Sunderland
```

I've confirmed via google that team1 was the home team for each of these games. I supposed there will be some games in the dataset played on neutral grounds as well. 

### Tidying Up
Given the nastiness cleaning with team numbers above, I'll probably want to create a tidy version of this dataset. What should that look like? 
- 2 Records for each game
- 1 "team" column
- Home or away indicator
- All metrics for team first, and then "opponent metrics"
- Win or Loss
- Should allow me to easily calculate difference between spi and opponent spi this way. Maybe I should just include the difference, not the actual opponent data?



```r
home_teams <- spi_matches %>%
  select(-contains("2")) %>% 
  mutate(home = 1)

names(home_teams) <- names(home_teams) %>% str_remove("[0-9]")

home_teams <- home_teams %>%
  select(match_id, date, league, league_id, team, home, spi, prob, proj_score, importance, score, xg, nsxg, adj_score)

away_teams <- spi_matches %>%
  select(-contains("1")) %>% 
  mutate(home = 0)

names(away_teams) <- names(away_teams) %>% str_remove("[0-9]")

away_teams <- away_teams %>%
  select(match_id, date, league, league_id, team, home, spi, prob, proj_score, importance, score, xg, nsxg, adj_score)

spi_matches_combined <- comb_home_away(home_teams, away_teams)

# Season is the main other piece of data I'd like to add at this time
spi_matches %>%
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(date, label = TRUE),
         year = lubridate::year(date)) %>% 
  count(year, month) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_expapp() +
  ggtitle("Total Matches by Month") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, name = "Num Matches")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](../graphs/matches//unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

```r
spi_matches2 <- spi_matches %>% 
  mutate(season = get_season(date))

spi_matches_tidy <- spi_matches_combined %>% 
  mutate(season = get_season(date))
  
matches_past <- spi_matches_tidy %>% 
  filter(!is.na(score))

matches_future <- spi_matches_tidy %>% 
  anti_join(matches_past %>% distinct(match_id), by = "match_id") %>% 
  filter(date > lubridate::today())

#saveRDS(spi_matches_tidy, "./data/fivethirtyeight/spi_matches_tidy.RDS")
```

#### Tidy Summary
Wow, tidying this data up was much more difficult than expected, but I think I'm a good place now with it. Each match will have 2 records (one for each team). This will make it easier to filter by team and quickly analyze wins / losses and compare to the opponent. New fields:
- `home` - 1 (home) or 0 (away)
- `diff` - column for every metric (team's minus opponent's)
- `result` - win, loss, or tie
- `points` - 3 for a win, 1 for a tie, 0 for a loss
- `season` - factors from 2014-15 to 2021-22

### Recreating League Tables
An interesting wrinkle is that some of these leagues are actually knockout tournaments, and we also have some match data for current seasons. I'd like to have a league reference table where I can quickly say whether a season is finished and whether it was a knockout tournament.



```r
matches_past %>% 
  group_by(league, season, team) %>% 
  summarise(games_played = n_distinct(match_id)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(league, season) %>% 
  summarise(max_team_gms = max(games_played),
            min_team_gms = min(games_played)) %>% 
  filter(max_team_gms != min_team_gms) %>% 
  head()
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 4
## # Groups:   league [4]
##   league                       season  max_team_gms min_team_gms
##   <chr>                        <fct>          <dbl>        <dbl>
## 1 Argentina Primera Division   2018-19            5            4
## 2 Austrian T-Mobile Bundesliga 2017-18           35            1
## 3 Brasileiro SÃ©rie A           2016-17           17           16
## 4 Brasileiro SÃ©rie A           2017-18           38           15
## 5 Brasileiro SÃ©rie A           2018-19           10            9
## 6 Chinese Super League         2018-19            9            8
```

Hmmmmm I'd hoped that looking at the descrepancy between max and min games played would tell me whether it was a tournament, but alot of genuine leagues have discrepancies in number of games played. I may just have to hard code that in. 


```r
season_results <- matches_past %>%
  filter(!(season %in% unique(matches_future$season))) %>% 
  group_by(league, season, team ) %>% 
  summarise(game_played = n(),
            points = sum(match_points),
            goal_diff = sum(diff_score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(league, season) %>% 
  mutate(league_position = row_number(-points)) %>% 
  arrange(league, season, -points, -goal_diff)
```

Interesting, seems like there is a bit of a trend with MLS and the Brasilian league, fivethirtyeight's model expects them to win at home more often than other leagues. Next I'll compare this to reality - do they actually win at home more often?

## Analysis Ideas
- Predicting promotion and relegation
- Classifying which games were played in neutral venues
- Overperformers and underperformers
- Predicting winners
- How does time between previous game affect team performance?
